herSimpleCurrentGoalInput is based on the single threaded version of HER (hersimple.

The main idea here is to incorporate the current achieved goal to the training inputs for both the actor
and critic networks. This comes from the idea that for a same goals and a same observation. the set of actions to
output should be different if the current achieved goal is different.
e.g.: hand flat (=observation), target is to have the pen along the Z axis. If the starting achieved goal is pen along X
      or pen along Y, the actions should be different.
